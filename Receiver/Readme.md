# Receiver
This is the Receiver of this project.

It will send the data received via the nRF24l01+ Module to a Computer using Serial (via USB).
This might be your Node-Red-Server RaspberryPi or anything else.

You can run this code either on a Wemos D1 Mini (compatible with many ESP8266 based Boards) or a Arduino Nano V3 (compatible with most Atmega 328p-based boards).
It is easy to adapt this code for any other board, too.
